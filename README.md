The purpose of this statistical model is to predict the probability of a company entering into default based on various financial and demographic characteristics. 
In this code, I used a dataset containing information about companies, including values such as liquidity, current assets, fixed assets, age, industry, 
and others. I employed a logistic regression model to assess the impact of each variable on the likelihood of default.

Variables used:

RDCP = Debt to Equity Ratio

LCH = Liquidity

RAIA = Fixed Assets to Total Assets Ratio

ROE = Return on Equity

ROA = Return on Assets

ROTA = Asset Turnover Ratio

PCA = Net Profit Margin

ACD = Current Assets to Debt Ratio

AIT = Fixed Assets to Total Assets Ratio

ACT = Current Assets to Total Assets Ratio

CAT = Revenue to Total Assets Ratio

PAT = Net Profit to Total Assets Ratio

varsta = years since the company's establishment

industria = industry

default = was the company able to return the loan? Yes/No
